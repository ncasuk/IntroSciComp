# Study scientific computing

**Dates: November 2021**

**Duration: 5 days (full-time)**

**Location: Online**

## Intro section...

The Introduction to Scientific Computing (ISC) course covers the skills 
needed to start using Linux and Python in environmental science research.

The aim of the course is to equip students with fundamental knowledge and 
skills that are essential for almost all researchers in modern scientific 
disciplines. Participants will learn how to use basic scripting 
to transfer and manage data, write modular code for automating repetitive 
tasks, use Python to handle/visualise scientific data and use version 
control systems to capture and manage their workflows effectively.

The course will also provide you with the necessary experience needed 
to attend our [Data Analysis Tools](https://www.ncas.ac.uk/study-with-us/data-analysis-tools/) course.

## HOW TO APPLY

Registration for 2021/22 courses will open by the end of September 2021.

The ISC course is designed for PhD students and early career researchers 
in atmospheric and environmental science.

It is suitable for those with no previous experience in either Linux or Python, 
as well as those who have used them a little and wish to improve their skills.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

Students will the learn the basics of:

- algorithmic thinking and working in the Linux Shell
- Python programming
- reading, writing and visualing scientific data with Python
- using Jupyter Notebooks
- version control with Git and GitHub

The course will provide:

- essential knowledge so that students can begin programming as part of their research/work
- experience to enable attendance at other technical courses

## TEACHING STAFF

You will be tutored by experts from the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) and
other NCAS institutions. The trainers have extensive experience of using Linux and Python to 
develop software for analysing and managing scientific data. CEDA manages (i) the multi-petabyte 
[CEDA Archive](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk/) of environmental data and (ii) the large-scale data 
analysis [JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk/) platform.

## COURSE SCHEDULE

The course is full-time for 5 days. 

The next course will be run entirely remotely using a range of technologies and access to 
JASMIN services. These will include:
- Zoom sessions for training presentations, live discussions and 1-to-1 support
- Slack for online discussions, information sharing and online support
- JASMIN Jupyter Notebook Service for Python teaching and interactive work (accessed via a web-browser)
- JASMIN compute services for Linux Shell, Git and other components

A team of trainers will be on-hand to ensure that participants are able to access support 
as required.
